  <h1>Computers</h1>
  <p>
    One thing I love doing is working on computers. I've built and repaired multiple systems, and I enjoy learning how they work inside and out.
    Below are a few of my favorite builds and teardowns.

  <h2>Gallery Slider</h2>
  <div class="slider" id="slider">
    <button class="slider-btn" onclick="prevSlide()">❮</button>

    <!-- Slide 1 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="Images/IMG_0266.jpeg" alt="PC Build with AIO">
      <p>This build uses an AIO cooler and was focused on clean cable management and efficient airflow.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 2 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="Images/IMG_0419.jpeg" alt="Laptop Teardown">
      <p>This was a learning project where I took apart a laptop to study its internal components.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 3 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <img src="Images/IMG_0421.jpeg" alt="Tower Build with RTX 5070">
      <p>This is one that I thought was really cool, its a full-size tower featuring an RTX 5070 GPU.</p>
    </div>
